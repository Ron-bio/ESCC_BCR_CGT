# ESCC_BCR_CGT

This repository contains matadata and codes necessary for analysis of the data of human ESCC presented in Wang et al. Cancer Gene Therapy, in revision (2023).

The TRUST4 was used to extract the IGH repertoire clones from the RNA-seq data.

The Change-O repertoire clonal assignment toolkit was used to define B cell clones.

The source data were used to draw the figures in the article. They needs to be unzipped before loading the scripts.
